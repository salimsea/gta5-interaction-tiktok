# GTA5 Interaction Tiktok | Modified From [smeysu](https://github.com/smeysu/GTA5-TikTok-Integration)

GTA5 Plugin to control GTA5 via Webhook events from TikTok LIVE. I recommend [TikFinity](https://tikfinity.zerody.one/) to setup Webhooks on certain events.

## Installation

- Make sure that GTA5 is not running.
- Download the latest plugin version from the [releases](https://github.com/smeysu/GTA5-TikTok-Integration/releases).
- Extract the downloaded ZIP archive.
- Copy all files and folders into your GTA 5 installation directory (The directory where the **GTA5.exe** is located).<br>
  The default installation directory is: `C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto V`<br>
  If you get it through Steam, the path is: `E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V` (The drive letter can vary)
- Restart GTA5 and start playing in offline/story mode.
- You can check if the plugin is running by opening http://127.0.0.1:6721/ in your browser.<br>If everything is working you will get the message `Its working!`.

Please note that the plugin installation may need to be repeated after a GTA5 update, since the GTA5 update process overwrites all files.

## Webhook Usage

The plugin offers several webhook URLs that can be used to trigger different actions in the game.<br>
The basic syntax is: `http://127.0.0.1:6721/<command>:<param>`<br>
All commands are defined in [GTAVWebhookScript.cs](https://github.com/smeysu/GTA5-TikTok-Integration/blob/main/GTAVWebhookScript.cs).<br>

## TikFinity Integration

The easiest way to trigger the webhooks through TikTok LIVE events is to use [TikFinity](https://tikfinity.zerody.one/). You can integrate up to 5 different webhooks for free. To integrate a webhook do the following:

<img align="right" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95110801/233436408-4214b3bf-46d6-4ed8-a2d7-9833d11f4b05.png" height=500>

### Create Action

- Go to **Actions & Events**
- Click on **Create new Action**
- Select **Trigger Webhook**
- Paste one of the Webhook URLs above (based on what you want to trigger in the game) and remember to adjust the number in the command if necessary. E.g. how many attackers you want to spawn.
- Scroll down and save the action.

### Create Event

- Click on **Create new Event**
- Define by what the action should be triggered. For example, "Sending a specific gift".
- At "Trigger all of these actions" select the previously created action.
- Scroll down and save the event.

Repeat the steps for all webhooks you want to integrate.

## Troubleshooting

If the plugin does not work as expected, it might be worth taking a look at the log files in the GTA 5 installation folder. This includes:

- `asiloader.log`
- `ScriptHookV.log`
- `ScriptHookVDotNet.log`
- `GTAVWebhook.log`

In case the loading of the `ScriptHookVDotNet` library fails, the reason could be a missing .NET Framework version. Please install [.NET Framework 4.8](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/microsoft-net-framework-4-8-offline-installer-for-windows-9d23f658-3b97-68ab-d013-aa3c3e7495e0) and try again.
